# FlowRouter
FlowRouter is a UIKit-based routing iOS component designed to simplify page navigation and data passing in iOS applications. By using custom route names, developers can more flexibly wrap ViewControllers into easy-to-understand routing interfaces, thereby avoiding the complex navigation operations such as push and present in traditional UIKit.
